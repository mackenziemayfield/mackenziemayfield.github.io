        <p>Because of the fashion show, i got to plan a trip to New York City. I went all around this<br> beautiful city. I saw the Empire State Building, One World Trade Center, 9/11 museum, and so much <br>more. Times Square is breathtaking. I was oversome with happiness the whole time I was there.</p>
